#### **DISCORD**

**What is Discord?**

Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and hang out with their communities and friends.

People use Discord daily to talk about many things, ranging from art projects and family trips to homework and mental health support. It's a home for communities of any size, but it's most widely used by small and active groups of people who talk regularly.

Also, discord turns out to be the home of team SAWO and along with its a community of more than 2000 budding developers who are there to discuss and develop.
