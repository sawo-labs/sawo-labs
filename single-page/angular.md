# Angular

## Let's Get your Angular App running with SAWO ðŸ™Œ

## **Requirements**

Node \[Version 12.x+ \] , Node Package Manager \(NPM\) \[Version 6.x+\]

## **Steps**

1. The first step to getting started with SAWO API integration into your Angular web page is to **install the sawo** package as given below:

```text
npm i sawo
```

2. After installation is done, you have to **import the Sawo class** from the installed sawo package to the top of the file:

```javascript
import Sawo from "sawo"
```

3. To use SAWO Login you would need an API key which can be obtained by creating a project in the [sawo dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/).

4. Once you create your project, you would need to set your **project name and hostname.**  
    4.1. For development in a local machine, the hostname should be set to 'localhost'.

{% hint style="info" %}
If using ''localhost" as hostname is not working for you, try "127.0.0.1" ðŸ¤“
{% endhint %}

    4.2. For production, the hostname should be set to your domain. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are adding your domain do not add 'https://', ''http://', 'www' or even trailing backslash.  
**Example:**  
`https://dev.sawolabs.com/` should be kept as `dev.sawolabs.com`
{% endhint %}

5. Copy the API key from the project and keep it safe and secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best practice to store your API key is to store values in .env so that they are not exposed.
{% endhint %}

6. Initialise SAWO and render the form according to the following steps:

* As part of this step, a container has to be created for the SAWO component. This has to be done on your projectâ€™s source file.

```text
<div id="sawo-container" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></div>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Every added custom field should be accompanied by a `50px` increase in the component height.
{% endhint %}

* Some configurations have to be checked as given below. The code given below should help in the same.

```text
 var config = {
        // should be same as the id of the container created on 3rd step
        containerID: "<container-ID>",
        // can be one of 'email' or 'phone_number_sms'
        identifierType: "phone_number_sms",
        // Add the API key copied from 2nd step
        apiKey: "",
        // Add a callback here to handle the payload sent by sdk
        onSuccess: (payload) => {},
    };
```

* Then a SAWO instance has to be created using the code given below:

```text
let sawo = new Sawo(config)
```

* The **showForm** method should be called thereafter as the **showForm** method is responsible for rendering the form in the given container.

```text
sawo.showForm()
```

7. Below code-block can be used as a reference after you have completed setting up your project:

```text
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import Sawo from "sawo"


@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

export class AppComponent {
  
  title = 'angular-sawo-chander';
  Sawo: any;
  isLoggedIn:any= false;
  userPayload:any = {};

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit(){
    const sawoConfig = {
      // should be same as the id of the container
      containerID: "sawo-container",
      // can be one of 'email' or 'phone_number_sms'
      identifierType: "phone_number_sms",
      // Add the API key
      apiKey: "",
      // Add a callback here to handle the payload sent by sdk
      onSuccess: (payload: any) => {
        this.userPayload = payload;
        this.isLoggedIn = true;
      }
    };
    // creating instance
    this.Sawo = new Sawo(sawoConfig)
  }

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.Sawo.showForm()
  }

}
```

8. Once the SAWO SDK is successfully set up, a **login form** will be rendered in the provided container as displayed in the picture below:
