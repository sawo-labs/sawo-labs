### Let's Get your HTML running with SAWO ðŸ™Œ

### **Requirements**



### **Steps**

1. To use SAWO Login you would need an **API key** which can be obtained by creating a project in the [sawo dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/). 

2.  Once you create your project, you would need to set your project name and hostname.  
    2.1 For development in a local machine, the hostname should be set to 'localhost'.

{% hint style="info" %}
If using ''localhost" as hostname is not working for you, try "127.0.0.1" ðŸ¤“ 
{% endhint %}

    2.2 For production, the hostname should be set to your domain

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are adding your domain do not add 'https://', ''http://', 'www' or even trailing backslash.  
**Example:**  
`https://dev.sawolabs.com/` should be kept as `dev.sawolabs.com`
{% endhint %}

3. Copy the API key from the project and keep it safe and secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best practice to store your API key is to store values in .env so that they are not exposed.
{% endhint %}

4. On your source, create a container for sawo component inside `body` tag

```text
<div id="sawo-container" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></div>
```

5. Add the snippet at bottom of source inside `body` tag

```text
<script src="https://websdk.sawolabs.com/sawo.min.js"></script>    
<script>
    var config = {
        // should be same as the id of the container created on 3rd step
        containerID: "sawo-container",
        // can be one of 'email' or 'phone_number_sms'
        identifierType: "phone_number_sms",
        // Add the API key copied from 2nd step
        apiKey: "",
        // Add a callback here to handle the payload sent by sdk
        onSuccess: (payload) => {
            console.log(payload)
        },
    };
    var sawo = new Sawo(config);
    sawo.showForm();
</script>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recommended**: Verify the payload sent by SDK from your backend:

Python Example

```text
import requests

data = {
    'user_id': payload_sent_from_sdk['user_id']
}
res = requests.post('https://api.sawolabs.com/api/v1/userverify/', data=data)
# Match the verification token in response with sdk payload
if res.status_code == 200:
    response_data = res.json()
    if response_data['verification_token'] \
                == payload_sent_from_sdk['verification_token']:
            # continue with your implementation for example add the user to your db
```
{% endhint %}

Once the SAWO SDK is successfully set up, a login form will be rendered in the provided container as displayed in the picture below:
