# Bubble

### **Steps** 

![API Integration on Bubble Demo](../.gitbook/assets/bubble-gif.gif)

1.To start with SAWO API Integration on Bubble, **install the SAWO plugin** from the marketplace.

2.Next, the **SAWO login** has to be located under **input** forms and a **new login page** has to be **created**

3.Post this, we need to drag and drop the **sawo-login form**

4.**Double** click on the form and select the **identifier** as 'email' or 'phone'

5.To use SAWO Login you would need an **API key** which can be obtained by creating a project in the [sawo dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/).

6.  Once you create your project, you would need to set your **project name and hostname.**  
    5.1. For **development** in a local machine, the hostname should be set to **'localhost'.**

{% hint style="info" %}
If using ''localhost" as hostname is not working for you, try "127.0.0.1" ðŸ¤“ 
{% endhint %}

       ****5.2. For the **production**, the hostname should be set to your **domain**. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are adding your domain do not add 'https://', ''http://', 'www' or even trailing backslash.  
**Example:**  
`https://dev.sawolabs.com/` should be kept as `dev.sawolabs.com`
{% endhint %}

7. Copy the **API key** from the project and keep it safe and secure.

### **Workflow of the website**

1. To use email,create two actions-

* **'user\_signs\_up'**
* **'user\_logs\_in'**

For the respective action, **trigger** login or signup function.

**Note:**

* For **sawo** â€™login form Aâ€™s identifier, mention it as an **email**
* For **sawo** â€™login form Aâ€™s password, mention it as a **password**

2.To use phone number-

* **Append** the custom text by making a **Text ID.**
* Visit the **language** section and mention the **domain** '@xyz.in' against your **Text ID.**
* Use **Phone number** as **email identifier.**
