SAWO was built in mind keeping and prioritizing both the user and the developer,  we already ship our SDKs with a beautiful frontend but you must be like a single frontend can suit every user and thus we have enabled no-code customisation directly through the developer dashboard, let me take you through the experience of customising using the dashboard

SAWO's Developer Dashboard is just another step by us to make the developers happy too, the dashboard is the place where you can setup N number of your projects, get the keys for them and the most amazing thing is that you can easily optimize how the page will look directly from here without having to worry about the code.
