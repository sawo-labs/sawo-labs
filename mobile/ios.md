1. To use SAWO Login you would need an **API key** which can be obtained by creating a project in the [sawo dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/). 

2. Copy the **API key** from the project and keep it safe and secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best practice to store your API key is to store values in .env so that they are not exposed.
{% endhint %}

**Congratulations !! The SAWO API is now ready to be used in your iOS application** ü§ò**.**
