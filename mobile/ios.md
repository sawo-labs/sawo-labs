### Let's Get your iOS App running with SAWO ðŸ™Œ 

### **Steps**

1. To use SAWO Login you would need an **API key** which can be obtained by creating a project in the [sawo dashboard](https://dev.sawolabs.com/). 

2.  Once you create your project, you would need to set your **project name and hostname.**  
    2.1. For **development** in a local machine, the hostname should be set to **'localhost'.**

{% hint style="info" %}
If using ''localhost" as hostname is not working for you, try "127.0.0.1" ðŸ¤“ 
{% endhint %}

    **2**.2. For **production**, the hostname should be set to your **domain.** 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are adding your domain do not add 'https://', ''http://', 'www' or even trailing backslash.  
**Example:**  
`https://dev.sawolabs.com/` should be kept as `dev.sawolabs.com`
{% endhint %}

3. Copy the **API key** from the project and keep it safe and secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best practice to store your API key is to store values in .env so that they are not exposed.
